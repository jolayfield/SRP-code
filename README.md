# SRP-code
A code to reparametrize semiempirical electronic-structure methods to reproduce molecular geometries and *ab initio* potential energy surfaces.

The inputs for the code include:
* Initial Parameters of the electronic-structure method (semi-empirical NDDO method or tight-binding method)
* Geometries uses to create vibrational potential-energy surface
* *Ab initio* energies for the molecule that correspond to each of the geometries found in the above file
*
